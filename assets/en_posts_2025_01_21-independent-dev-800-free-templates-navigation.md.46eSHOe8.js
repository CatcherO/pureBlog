As the founder, I firmly believe that success often begins with a good template rather than starting from scratch. This belief is reflected in the site&#39;s name: &quot;template&quot; comes before &quot;0,&quot; and the &quot;0&quot; symbolizes that all templates are free ($0).</p><p>This project addresses three main pain points:</p><ul><li>High-quality free templates are difficult to discover and lack sufficient exposure.</li><li>Users find it challenging to quickly locate free templates that meet their needs.</li><li>There is a lack of a platform for exploring and enhancing website aesthetics.</li></ul><p>The website offers a variety of features, including:</p><ul><li>A categorized filtering system</li><li>Curated collection displays</li><li>Blog content output</li><li>Free template submissions</li><li>Personal collection functionality</li></ul><p>Currently, the site has 4,000 monthly active users and 14,000 page views, with steady growth. We maintain operations through sponsorships, ensuring that all content remains free for users. We welcome everyone to explore and collect their favorite templates, and creators are encouraged to submit their own works!</p><blockquote><p>Original link: <a href="https://template0.com/blog/launch-v1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">template0.com</a></p></blockquote><p>We are currently launching on <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/template0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">ProductHunt</a>.

It has two meanings:</p><ol><li>I firmly believe that success begins with a template, not from scratch. The &quot;template&quot; comes before &quot;0&quot;, representing this meaning.</li><li>You can also consider 0 as $0, meaning all the templates here are free of charge.</li></ol><p>Why create such a website? To put it simply, there are three purposes:</p><ol><li>High-quality free templates are often forgotten in some corner. This is a showcase site for free templates.</li></ol><ul><li>When searching keywords on Google, free templates are often overshadowed by paid template results.</li><li>Because the templates are free, many creators don&#39;t invest much effort in promotion, making it difficult for quality templates to gain visibility.</li><li>Many free templates created by people do not have a specific place for display. Template0 is such a directory website that showcases creators&#39; works and provides a platform for explorers to discover them.</li></ul><ol start="2"><li>Desired free templates are hard to find.</li></ol><ul><li>Many templates lack detailed information on purpose, tech stack, or preview images, making it difficult for those seeking templates to find what they need.</li><li>Many free templates require registration to download. These have been filtered out.</li><li>All templates go through a basic screening to ensure good appearance and include a live demo.</li></ul><ol start="3"><li>Aesthetic sense stems from exploration.</li></ol><ul><li>This is another reason for creating this site: to encourage exploration and experiencing others&#39; websites, thus enhancing one&#39;s aesthetic sense.</li><li>All website content is manually collected or user-submitted, rather than being scraped in large quantities by web crawlers.</li><li>I will continually keep an eye on industry trends, collecting high-quality free templates as I encounter them. The site&#39;s content is continuously updated.</li></ul><h2 id="preview-and-feature-overview" tabindex="-1">Preview and Feature Overview <a class="header-anchor" href="#preview-and-feature-overview" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Preview and Feature Overview&quot;">​</a></h2><h3 id="homepage" tabindex="-1">Homepage <a class="header-anchor" href="#homepage" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Homepage&quot;">​</a></h3><p>The homepage includes a hero section, quick search access, sponsor section, latest releases section, featured section, blog post section, email subscription section, and footer.</p><p>Preview：</p><p><img src="https://oss.justin3go.com/blogs/home1.png" alt=""></p><p><img src="https://oss.justin3go.com/blogs/home2.png" alt=""></p><p><img src="https://oss.justin3go.com/blogs/home3.png" alt=""></p><h3 id="category-filter-page" tabindex="-1">Category Filter Page <a class="header-anchor" href="#category-filter-page" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Category Filter Page&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Here, more filtering options are provided to help everyone quickly find their desired free templates, such as by purpose, tech stack, whether it&#39;s featured, preview images, release date, and alphabetical order of names.</p><p>There is also a sponsor carousel module at the top, and at the bottom, there are email subscription and footer modules similar to those on the homepage.</p><p>Preview：</p><p><img src="https://oss.justin3go.com/blogs/category.png" alt=""></p><h3 id="collection-page" tabindex="-1">Collection Page <a class="header-anchor" href="#collection-page" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Collection Page&quot;">​</a></h3><p>To support everyone in exploring and discovering others&#39; free templates from different dimensions, Template0 offers curated collections.</p><p>Preview：</p><p><img src="https://oss.justin3go.com/blogs/collection.png" alt=""></p><h3 id="blog-page" tabindex="-1">Blog Page <a class="header-anchor" href="#blog-page" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Blog Page&quot;">​</a></h3><p>In addition, to continuously produce content and increase search engine exposure, Template0 also includes a Blog page.
